    Game Timer

    Manages sending out game announcements at a regular interval.
    Can only handle one announcement channel for one server.

    Optionally automatically retrieves epic games that became free the current day before announcing games.

    Currently, the announcement runs once a day.

    If the announcement is made to run multiple times in one day, any posted epic games will be posted every time.
    This is because, as is, retrieved epic games for an announcement are not remembered after that announcement.

    If the announcement frequency is ever increased to be more than 1 per day,
    the auto retrieved games already posted will need to be remembered somehow.
